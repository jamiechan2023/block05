        <h2>Bears</h2>
        <p>
          Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː,
          -daɪ/). They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
          Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread,
          appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the
          Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears
          are found on the continents of North America, South America, and
          Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies
          with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair,
          plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

        <h2>Giraffes</h2>
        <p>
          The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
          Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
          ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one
          species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
          researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due
          to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as
          morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are
          known from the fossil record.

        <p>
          muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a
          hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult
          male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a
          social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists
          of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
          lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
          lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge
          when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions
          typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

        <p>
          Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
          infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all
          animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
          except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic
          grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes
          (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians
          synonyms in regard to their scope.
